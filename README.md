# Logistic-Regression
1. Your computer should have python 2.7 installed and run this program with this verison.
2. Clone all the files into one folder.
3. Read introduction.pdf for the introduction of this algorithm and the code.
4. cd to this folder, command line input python logistic_regression.py toytrain.tsv toyvalidation.tsv toytest.tsv model1train_out.labels model1test_out.labels model1metrics_out.txt 2 1. These are small dataset for model 1. Check the output.
5. Command line input: python logistic_regression.py toytrain.tsv toyvalidation.tsv toytest.tsv model2train_out.labels model2test_out.labels model2metrics_out.txt 2 2. Check output for this small dataset for model2.
6. Command line input: python logistic_regression.py train.tsv validation.tsv test.tsv model1train_out.labels model1test_out.labels model1metrics_out.txt 2 1. Check output for this large dataset for model1. It may take several minutes to run.
