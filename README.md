# Logistic-Regression
1. Your computer should have python 2.7 installed and run this program with this verison.
2. Clone all the files into one folder.
3. Read Introduction_for_logistic_regression.pdf for the introduction of this algorithm and the code.
4. cd to this folder, command line input python logistic_regression.py toytrain.tsv toyvalidation.tsv toytest.tsv model1train_out.labels model1test_out.labels model1metrics_out.txt 2 1. These are small dataset for model 1. Check the output.
5. Command line input: python logistic_regression.py toytrain.tsv toyvalidation.tsv toytest.tsv model2train_out.labels model2test_out.labels model2metrics_out.txt 2 2. Check output for this small dataset for model2.
6. Command line input: python logistic_regression.py train.tsv validation.tsv test.tsv model1train_out.labels model1test_out.labels model1metrics_out.txt 2 1. Check output for this large dataset for model1. It may take several minutes to run.
